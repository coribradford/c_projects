main data types are:
	int - a whole number, -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
	float - a number with possible decimals, 6 decimal places
	double - a number with possible decimals (more precise), 15 decimal places
	char - stores one character (letter or number), a single character

declaring and initializing data types
	type variable_name
	make more than one of the same type with
	type var1, var2, var3, var4

variable names
	c doesnt allow just anything to be a variable name
	names can be composed of upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores
	first character must be a letter (upper or lower)
	no keywords are allowed as the full name (think int or float, int_count would be fine)

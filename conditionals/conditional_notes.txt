if, else if, and else statements
	format is:
		if (conditional statement) {
				code to execute;
		} else if (condition) {
				other code to execute
		} else {
				final code possible to execute
		}
		An else statement can be left “dangling” if it’s unclear which conditional the statement is actually connected to.
switch statements
	switch statement must evaluate to an integer (int, char, short, long, long long, or enum)
	include the break because if not, the matching case would evaluate and then all following cases
	ex: 
		switch (grade) {
			case 9:
					printf("Freshman\n");
					break;
			case 10:
					printf("Sophomore\n");
					break;
			case 11:
					printf("Junior\n");
					break;
			case 12:
					printf("Senior\n");
					break;
			default:
					printf("Invalid\n");
					break;
		}
logical operators can be used to test multiple conditions at once
	if this is true or that is true
	if this is true and that is true
	etc
relational operators compare values and evaluate to either true or false
Ternary operators
	condition ? do something : do something else;
	shorthand for if/else statements
	can set variables equal to the result of a ternary operator

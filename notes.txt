case sensitivity
	most words use lowercase, code is case-sensitive

semicolon
	all statements need to end with a semicolon, signifies the end of a statement

double quotes
	text between double quotes (") is a string, all strings must be surrounded by double quotes

errors
	look like:

	script.c: In function ‘main’:
	script.c:6:1: error: expected ‘;’ before ‘}’ token
 	}

	gives info: 
		in function 'main'
		line and column number 6:1
		description 'expected ';' before '}'

escape sequences
	put inside the string to add a non-visual character within the string
	\n - newline escape sequence
	\t - tab escape sequence

//single line comment - can put at the end of a line

/*
multi line comments
*/

compiling
	compiler is the program that converts the code into an executable program that can be run by the computer
	widely used is the gcc compiler - GNU compiler collection
	ex:
		gcc helloWorld.c -o helloWorld
		gcc is running the compiler application
		helloWorld.c is the filename of the code to be compiled
		-o helloWorld is an optional addition that specifies the name of the output file
			if left off, the output would be called a.out by default
	to run the executable file after compilation, use the ./helloWorld command

printf(); prints to the console
